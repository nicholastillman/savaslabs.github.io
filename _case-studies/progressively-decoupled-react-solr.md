project_description: |
 With the goal of improving e-commerce conversions, we identified the opportunity to greatly enhance the user experience of the search page. We leveraged the best modern frontend framework to craft a faceted, snappy search application within the Omega institute's website the included spell-checking and auto-completion and was powered by two data sources: Apache Solr and Drupal.
project_objective: |
 World-class workshops and educators are at the core of the Omega experience and why people come to their website. It was of paramount importance to our client's organizational success to provide an effective means for site visitors to _quickly_ discover and purchase an experience through the website. Improving ecommerce conversion rates is critical to their success.
project_process: |
 In our research, we learned the search page, though popular, had lagging conversion rates. The existing design was not taking advantage of the power of Apache Solr. Given Omega's breadth of programming, we desired to provide granularity for visitors to hone in on their interests whether seeking a specific topic, location, schedule, or teacher. Given the existing search was powered by Apache Solr, we knew there was opportunity to create a sophisticated and more interactive user experience.
project_results: |
 Taking a progressively decoupled approach, we replaced the Drupal search view with an embedded React application. The application achieves app-like speeds as much of it interacts directly with the lightning-fast, low overhead, Apache Solr index. We're also able to include the robustness  also wanted to take advantage of extra meta-data possiblities to allow our client to tailor    out and added spell-check which does bootstrap Drupal. Some services communicate directly with the Solr server, and others bootstrap Drupal to achieve the best compromise of blazing-fast speed with comprehensive access to the robust content. The team was happy. We talked about it at conferences. We made some updates to search options based on analytics and further tracking that we do as part of a larger KIP initiative.
